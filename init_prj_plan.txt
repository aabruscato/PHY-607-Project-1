progam pseudocode

    1. define physical parameters (masses, spring constants)
       m1 = m2 = m = #
       k1 = k2 = k3 = k = #
    2. define initial conditions (positions, velocities)
       x1 = #
       x2 = #
       x1_dot = #
       x2_dot = #
    3. define time parameters (start time, end time, time step)
       to = 0
       tf = #
       dt = 0.00001?
       number of time steps? total time/dt
    4. solve the ODE using:
        - euler's method (explicit)
        - runge-kutta 4 method
        - scipy integrator (for comparison)

    5. store the time evolution of the system (positions and velocities)

    6. at each time step, calculate the total energy of the system:
        - use kinetic and potential energy expressions

    7. use numerical integration methods to compute the total energy over time:
        - riemann sum
        - trapezoidal rule
        - simpson's rule
        - compare to scipyâ€™s quad or simps

    8. plot results:
        - position vs. time
        - energy vs. time
        - energy integral vs. method

    9. output results to screen or file
